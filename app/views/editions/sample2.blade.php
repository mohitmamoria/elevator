						<p>Winters - the perfect season to laze around! But do you know, there are two guys at some far-off place, sitting in a basement, wrapped in blankets and <em>doing</em> the thing that you're only <em>planning</em> to do tomorrow.</p>
						<p>I don't know who they are. It's very probable that they are in their early 20s but I am not sure how they look like. I don't even know what they are working on, but I know one thing for sure - they are hustling right now (and it's past midnight in their timezone).</p>
						<p>They might fail at whatever they are doing. But does it matter? Once fallen, they will get up, dust their shirts off and start afresh. And someday you will find them all over the internet as yet another <strong>overnight success story</strong>.</p>

						<h2 class="heading-edition">Hustle</h2>
						<p>Who puts it better than everyone else? <strong>Gary Vaynerchuk</strong>. If you want to do one favour to yourself today, then follow this guy everywhere you can - <a href="http://twitter.com/mohitmamoria">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GaryVaynerchuk">Youtube</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gary">Facebook</a>.</p>

							<p>The dream is free, but the hustle is sold separately.</p>
							<small>Gary Vaynerchuk</small>
						</blockquote>
						<p>Inspired by Gary's style, I too once tried writing a blog post about hustle. Here's the whole post in under 140-words.</p>
					</article>

					<article class="summary text-edition spaced-out-h padder-v">
						<h4 class="heading-edition">Want weekends off? Work your ass off, first!</h4>
						<p>The post starts with a simple question - <strong>"What price are you ready to pay for your dreams?"</strong> And keeps the momentum up throughout by pressing the point that "things that are worth becoming your dream, should not and do not come for free". And the price for your dreams is the "work". You gotta work. Every. Single. Day.</p>

						<blockquote>No one's busy. Stop watching fucking 'Games of Thrones'.</blockquote>

						<p>And the simple answer to your "I-will-burnout-quickly" argument is to not go to bed satisfied. Anxiety when going to bed will help you kickstart your next day.</p>

						<p>And in closing, there's an action plan - take out a piece of paper, write down your dream, price you'd pay and the deadline. And read the paper everyday, twice.</p>

						<p>And here's an interesting one from <a href="https://twitter.com/alexmturnbull">Alex Turnbull</a> - Founder of Groove.</p>
					</article>

					<article class="summary text-edition spaced-out-h padder-v">
						<h4 class="heading-edition">Why I Walked Away From a $12M Acquisition Offer 18 Months After Our Startupâ€™s Launch</h4>
						<p>This was the hardest decision Alex has ever made. The story is not how he got the offer or how he decline it, but why he declined it. Execs at a big software company approached Alex when they were doing monthly revenue of $70k and offered $12mn (14x annual revenue) to acquire. He owned more than 50% of the company and the offer was tempting but he declined. Here's why.</p>

						<blockquote><p>First-time founders care most about their exit. Every time after that, you focus on legacy.</p></blockquote>

						<ul>
							<li>After acquisition, simple products turn bloated</li>
							<li>The email promising "we will remain the same" always turns out to be bullshit</li>
							<li>He didn't set out to create a company for acquisition</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Finally, going by the growth, they would be worth $24mn in one year and $43mn in two years. There's no reason to get acquired then.</p>

						<h2 class="heading-edition">Meaningful Hustle</h2>
						
						<p>Now, I've learnt that we should not just hustle, but hustle for a purpose. Hustling at a day-job you hate is a waste. Instead, do the thing you love from 9pm to 2am and do it with all your heart.</p>
