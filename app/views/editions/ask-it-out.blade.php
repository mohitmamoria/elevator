		<p>Often I tend to come out as shameless. Or more aptly - creepy, because I ask the tough questions right on face rather than trying to assume answers myself and base whole decision on them.</p>

		<p>I recall, when launching <a href="http://horntell.com">Horntell</a> at an event, I came to know <a href="https://twitter.com/RajanAnandan">Rajan Anandan</a> (of Google) was in audience looking to make one of his angel investment there itself. What did I do? From the stage, I asked him for his money:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>"I've been told that you don't get what you don't ask for. So, let me just do it right here. Mr Rajan Anandan, may we have your money?"</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>My question was answered by whole audience with a loud round of applause. Rajan gave us <a href="https://twitter.com/RajanAnandan/status/541137770744258560">some love on Twitter</a> and connected us with some helpful people (though he couldn't put his own money because of one of his competing investment).</p>

		<p>You don't get answers until you ask out the questions.</p>

		<h4 class="heading-edition">How to Be Amazingly Good at Asking Questions</h4>
		<p>When asking a question, you should be very clear about what you need for an answer. Do you need a factually correct answer? Do you need an expert opinion? Do you need a well-reasoned judgment? Be precise.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Don't ask Yes/No questions</strong>: Instead ask the questions with an open-end. Questions with 'who,' 'what,' 'where,' 'when,' 'how,' or 'why' lead to people giving some thought to their answers.</li>
			<li><strong>Dig deeper</strong>: Always consider using follow-up questions like, 'What makes you think that?'</li>
			<li><strong>Stay silent</strong>: People have more information and will bring it out in moments of silence to fill in the gaps.</li>
			<li><strong>Don't interupt</strong>: Ask your question, then let the person answer it in full, even when you think you are not getting the answer you want.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>How can we forget our own <a href="https://twitter.com/garyvee">Gary</a> when it comes down to 'asking' questions. He does a whole Youtube show (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs">#AskGaryVee</a>) where anyone can ask him questions and he'll answer.</p>

		<p>In <a href="/editions/passenger-or-pilot#no-to-customer">one edition</a>, we saw how saying 'No' is important and why we should say it more often. But, human nature has it that the reason we are afraid of asking questions is because of this two-letter word. Let's see what <a href="https://twitter.com/iwearyourshirt">Jason Zook</a> says.</p>

		<span class="wisdom-label"><a href="#no-ask-no-getting"><i class="fa fa-anchor"></i></a> Article</span>
		<h4 class="heading-edition">You Don't Get What You Don't Ask For</h4>
		<p>We, humans are afraid to ask things - including <em>'asking people to buy our product'</em>, <em>'asking that girl out'</em>, <em>'asking for a raise'</em>.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>We're afraid to ask because we fear rejection.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Rejection is unbelievably powerful to derail people from asking for that thing again. It makes us feel we don't deserve what we are asking for. The feeling of getting rejected after you've asked someone out for a date sticks with you for years to come.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>100 people could tell you how freaking amazing you look today, but if one person says you look like crap, those 100 positive messages won't matter.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>If Jason has to credit his success to something, it'd be these two things:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I wasn't afraid to ask for things most people wouldn't dare ask for.</li>
			<li>I was willing to work my ass off to get the thing I wanted, because it was something I was really passionate about.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>People may go awe when they hear that he made $1,000,000 but what they don't get to hear is how much 'ask' Jason hsa done to reach there. They don't get to know about those 15000 emails that he sent to reach there. He overcame his fear of 'making the ask' was that he believed in himself.</p>

		<p>And this comes straight from the man himself - Steve Jobs.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Most people don't get what they want because they never ask. I've never found anybody that didn't want to help me if I asked them for help. I've never found someone who'd said NO or hung up the phone when I called. I just asked. And when people ask me, I try to be as responsive to pay that debt of gratitude back. Most people never pick up the phone and call, most people don't ask. That's what separate the people who do things from the people who only dreams about them.</p>
