		<p>I am lazy. Like most geeks (and unlike most gentlemen), I trim my beard only once in a week. Reason? Because it doesn't grow so much in a day that it shows up. But interestingly, after a week, it does. Every Sunday, I think the same thing, <em>"This is so interesting. Beard grows very little in a day, but when it happens for 7 days in a row - boom - there it is, making me look nerdier."</em></p>

		<p>Don't all the great things in life (and startups), happen the same way? Walking a long mile happens one step at a time. Completing a book happens one page at a time. Composing a song happens one note at a time. Building this Elevator is happening one edition at a time.</p>

		<p>All these little things don't look significant individually, but together, they make big things happen. A single Lego piece is of no great value. But when you've got 65,000 of those little devils, this shit happens:</p>

		<p>On the same note, Paul Graham has a very interesting and yet simple growth plan for startups.</p>
		
		<blockquote class="text-sm">
			<p>If you have 100 users, you need to get 10 more next week to grow 10% a week. And while 110 may not seem much better than 100, if you keep growing at 10% a week you'll be surprised how big the numbers get. After a year you'll have 14,000 users, and after 2 years you'll have 2 million.</p>
