						<p>Winters - the perfect season to laze around! But do you know, there are two guys at some far-off place, sitting in a basement, wrapped in blankets and <em>doing</em> the thing that you're only <em>planning</em> to do tomorrow.</p>
						<p>I don't know who they are. It's very probable that they are in their early 20s but I am not sure how they look like. I don't even know what they are working on, but I know one thing for sure - they are hustling right now (and it's past midnight in their timezone).</p>
						<p>They might fail at whatever they are doing. But does it matter? Once fallen, they will get up, dust their shirts off and start afresh. And someday you will find them all over the internet as yet another <strong>overnight success story</strong>.</p>

						<h2>Hustle</h2>
						<p>Who puts it better than everyone else? <strong>Gary Vaynerchuk</strong>. If you want to do one favour to yourself today, then follow this guy everywhere you can - <a href="http://twitter.com/mohitmamoria">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GaryVaynerchuk">Youtube</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gary">Facebook</a>.</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>The dream is free, but the hustle is sold separately.</p>
							<small>Gary Vaynerchuk</small>
						</blockquote>

						<p>Inspired by Gary's style, I too once tried writing a blog post about hustle. Here's the whole post in under 140-words.</p>

						<section class="panel hbox">
							<aside class="bg-info r-l text-center v-middle">
								<div class="wrapper">
									<h2 class="font-thin"><em>Want weekends off? Work your ass off, first!</em></h2>
								</div>
							</aside>
							<aside>
								<div class="pos-rlt">
									<span class="arrow left hidden-xs"></span>
									<div class="panel-body font-thin">
										<p>The post starts with a simple question - <strong>"What price are you ready to pay for your dreams?"</strong> And keeps the momentum up throughout by pressing the point that "things that are worth becoming your dream, should not and do not come for free". And the price for your dreams is the "work". You gotta work. Every. Single. Day.</p>

										<blockquote>No one's busy. Stop watching fucking 'Games of Thrones'.</blockquote>

										<p>And the simple answer to your "I-will-burnout-quickly" argument is to not go to bed satisfied. Anxiety when going to bed will help you kickstart your next day.</p>

										<p>And in closing, there's an action plan - take out a piece of paper, write down your dream, price you'd pay and the deadline. And read the paper everyday, twice.</p>

						<h2>Meaningful Hustle</h2>
						<p>Now, I've learnt that we should not just hustle, but hustle for a purpose. Hustling at a day-job you hate is a waste. Instead, do the thing you love from 9pm to 2am and do it with all your heart.</p>

							<p>Do what you love as hard as you can.</p>

						<p>I was reading a book (The One Thing by Gary Keller) and the first page had the best thing I've read in recent times.</p>

						<p>And in the closing, I leave you with this to shake you up. Remember, those two guys in the basement are actually doing their shit. Everyday.</p>
